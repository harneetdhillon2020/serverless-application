## Reflection
The only issue I faced when doing this assignment was during testing. I got an `AccessDeniedException` when trying to make a `POST` request. After doing some research, I found that I had to go to the IAM console and attach a policy called `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`. The policy grants permissions to perform any action on any DynamoDB resource within my AWS account. This includes all the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as well as other administrative tasks. After adding this policy, I was successfuly able to make a `POST` request. I learned a lot from using these AWS services. I didn't know AWS offered so many easy-to-use services. I had no idea what Lambda, Dynamo DB, or API Gateway was. I learned how to set up and use AWS Lambda and DynamoDB as well as deploy my first serverless application.
